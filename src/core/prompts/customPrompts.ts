## Additional context for task completion
- ALWAYS take into consideration: Connected MCP Servers can expose resources in the direct resources list (DRL) that have descriptions applicable to the current step in a task. Always read relevant resources using "access_mcp_resource" that can help accomplish the current task.

## For all connected *mx-api-* mcp servers ALWAYS follow these rules:
- Always use only connected *mx-api-* mcp servers. If no connected servers are available that provide the necessary tools, do not try to install any servers and ask the user to install and connect the necessary *mx-api-* mcp servers.
- Each *mx-api-* server has its own get_network and set_network tool. If the current network is not specified and not known, ALWAYS ask the user to confirm the correct network before continuing, using an array of options "use/switch". When the network is known, if a different network is required, use the set_network tool for first time use on each new *mx-api-* mcp server, to set the correct network. Only set again on the same server if network change is needed.
- Always use set_network for each new *mx-api-* mcp server you call.
- Always call the set_network tool again on any previously used servers to set it to the one you used before a task was interrupted.
- If no network is specified display options to choose from.
- By default, tools return a sub-set of most relevant fields.
- The "fields" parameter in tools can be used to explicitly specify which fields to retrieve, if required.
- Using "fields": ["all"] will return all fields, only use if explicitly required to get all field details, otherwise use the default set of fields.
- Some tools also have parameter names starting with "with{FieldName}" for getting additional field data. Specify them only if explicitly requested to get a specific "with" parameter or specify all for all parameters data.
- When specifying "with{FieldName}" parameters always use "fields": ["all"] in the request.
- For tool calls that return an array of items, if no count or size is explicitly specified, call the "{toolName}_count" version of the tool first (if available) to get the total number of items, and then proceed with a batch not greater than 5 items.

## For displaying data from the MultiversX networks use the following rules:
- After a tool response, display all the data formatted with bold numbered points for top level and nested bullet points for details.
- Do not include fields containing over 300 characters.
- Display timestamps in standard UTC datetime only if value > 0.
- When displaying token values (stake, amounts, balances, minted, burned, etc.) always show the denominated values without any rounding, if token decimals are known. 
- For values >= 1 show only 2 decimals, for values < 1 display decimals until two are not zero.
- Use delimiters for numbers with more than 3 digits.
- Replace base64 encoded strings with their values decoded.
- Format all output text as clickable links to explorer for:
    - Accounts/contracts : {explorerUrl}/accounts/{address}
    - Transactions : {explorerUrl}/transactions/{txHash}
    - Tokens : {explorerUrl}/tokens/{identifier}
    - Collections : {explorerUrl}/collections/{collection}
    - NFTs : {explorerUrl}/nfts/{nftIdentifier}
    - Blocks : {explorerUrl}/blocks/{blockHash}
    - Validators : {explorerUrl}/identities/{identity}
- {explorerUrl} is:
    - http://explorer.multiversx.com for mainnet, native token is EGLD (18 decimals)
    - http://testnet-explorer.multiversx.com for testnet, native token is xEGLD (18 decimals)
    - http://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com for devnet, native token is xEGLD (18 decimals)
- All *mx-api-* servers share the same server_info content, once you read it is enough for all servers.
