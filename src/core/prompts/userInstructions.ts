CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be always followed without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

# Using Instruction Files

- Instruction files can reference other instruction detail files in a "./content/" subfolder.
- The "./" part represents the root directory in which the main instruction file is located.
- For example:
	- for the file "./${workspaceInstructionsDirectoryPath}/{library}/{topic}/instruction-file.md", "./" represents "./${workspaceInstructionsDirectoryPath}/{library}/{topic}/".
	- for the file "${globalInstructionsDirectoryPath}/{library}/{topic}/instruction-file.md", "./" represents "${globalInstructionsDirectoryPath}/{library}/{topic}/".
- Make sure to use the correct path when referencing files in the "./content/" subfolder, for example "{instructionDirectory}/{library}/{topic}/content/{subtopic}/related-instruction-file.md".
- Instruction detail files can also reference other instruction detail files. Always read their content as needed.
- Never act on prior knowledge if a related instructions details file exists. Read the related instructions details file first.
- Before thinking about a solution, always read first the related instructions files using the read_file tool.
