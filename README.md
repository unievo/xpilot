# Welcome to xPilot

xPilot is an AI software engineering agent with a mission to accelerate development on [MultiversX](https://www.multiversx.com).

xPilot can use AI models to plan and execute tasks, create and edit files, read terminal output and execute commands in the terminal. It is also able to access external tools, resources and APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

xPilot can work with models with different capabilities, though it achieves the best results with agentic models that understand coding, tools and tool use, such as Claude Sonnet.

If you already have [Copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot) installed, or other VS Code extensions that provide a model API, xPilot can use it so you don't need to configure another API key.
