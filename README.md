# Welcome to xPilot

xPilot is an AI software engineering agent with a mission to accelerate development on [MultiversX](https://www.multiversx.com).

It uses AI models to plan and execute tasks and it is able to access external tools and data using the Model Context Protocol. It can work with different models and it achieves the best results with models trained for coding and tool use, such as Claude Sonnet 3.5 and up, or the latest Google Gemini  2.5 Pro and OpenAI GPT-4.1 models.

xPilot can use many different providers and you can also bring your own API key. Or you can sign up with Open Router or Cline. It can also use supported models in VS Code, or any VS Code based IDE. You can set up [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup) and [enable](https://github.com/settings/copilot) the Copilot models. 
xPilot can use them without another API key or subscription, by selecting VS Code from the AI API providers list.

## MCP Servers Library

xPilot now includes an MCP Servers Library, which allows for easily installing, running, and using the MCP servers. This library simplifies the process of managing server instances and provides a unified interface.
